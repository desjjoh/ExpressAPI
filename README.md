# QuickAPI-Express

Same design goals as QuickAPI: clean structure, logging, error handling, persistence, and production Docker setup.

🪜 Step 1 — Boilerplate Setup

✅ Initialize project with npm init, TypeScript, ESM, and Express.
✅ Add "type": "module", tsconfig.json, and server.ts with a basic “Hello World” route.
✅ Confirm it runs via npm run dev.

🔧 Step 2 — Environment + Configuration

Add dotenv + Zod for validated environment variables (port, node env, etc).
Ensure the app fails fast on bad config.

📜 Step 3 — Logging

Integrate Pino (pretty in dev, JSON in prod) and structured request logging.

🧱 Step 4 — Error Handling

Create a unified error middleware and simple HttpError class for consistent JSON responses.

🧩 Step 5 — Validation

Introduce Zod for route-level input validation (e.g., POST /users body schema).

🗄️ Step 6 — Database Integration

Pick Prisma (or Drizzle) and wire a User model with migrations and a health check.

🔐 Step 7 — Security + Stability

Add Helmet, CORS, compression, rate-limiting, and graceful shutdown.

📈 Step 8 — Health & Metrics

Add /health endpoint, Prometheus /metrics, and logging of uptime + DB status.

🐳 Step 9 — Docker & Deploy

Containerize with Docker + Compose for API + DB; refine scripts for CI/CD.
